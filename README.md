# Secure Login/Sign Up page

## About The Website
This page was a cybersecurity project where I was tasked to create some type of application that 
has a secure sign-up and log-in section. All personal info is encrypted, and all passwords are hashed with a salt. Please note that this project is not currently very secure.
Currently, everything is done on the front-end, but with due time, this will be transformed into a full-stack webpage for logging in and signing up.

The main languages used in this project are react, javascript, and tailwind. I do want this to be understood, I did not style the website and will not take credit for it. I had Gemini style the website to test how the AI-Chatbot understands the core rules of website styling, and it did a great job.
